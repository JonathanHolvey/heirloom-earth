		<h1>About Heirloom Earth</h1>
		<p>When attempting to think of a name for this blog, I struggled quite a lot. It is all about sustainable living, but I just couldn’t pinpoint the perfect words to sum up this concept well. It was when thinking of my garden that the words came to me.</p>
		<p>Heirloom Earth because our actions today will be our legacy tomorrow. Heirlooms are special items we pass on to those we love the most. The earth is the giver and supporter of life, what more precious heirloom could there be?</p>
		<p>Heirloom Earth because I’m inspired by heirloom produce. In a world where production is ever more focused on monocultures, heirloom vegetables provide a diversity of colour and flavour. More importantly, they add resilience to our agricultural system, and disease is avoided by introducing produce that that is resistant to it. Diversity and resilience - two of the most important aspects of environmental, social and economic sustainability. </p>
