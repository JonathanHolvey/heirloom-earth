Since starting my sustainability journey, the biggest challenge for me has been pairing my love for the planet with my love for beautiful interior decorating. I've had this passion since a very young age; as a child I would spend weekends dragging my furniture around my bedroom, rearranging it into new positions several times a month, and deliberating over which position on the shelf my dried out starfish and dolphin ornaments would look best in. Can you tell I grew up in the 90s?

The struggle I've found with matching these passions is that interior decorating is transitional in nature; everything is 'on trend'. It feels so tied to consumer society and in contrast to my values for environmental and social sustainability.

However, what I've come to learn is that, like all decisions in life, we have the power to weigh up the costs and benefits of our choices. Through research, we can find out the true impact of our decisions on the planet. A helpful tool for me has been thinking about furniture and other interior items in terms of the global system they are a part of and considering the environmental and social impacts of producing, using and disposing of this item ([life cycle analysis](http://sustainabilityskills.net.au/what-is-sustainability/sustainability-practice/design-and-technology/product-life-cycle/)).

Some negative environmental impacts of consumption of all goods include greenhouse gas emissions from energy use to produce a product, land clearing to produce the raw materials, emissions from transport, pollution from plastic packaging, and addition to landfill at end of life. Negative social impacts can be from worker exploitation and unfair working conditions.

By analysing the [waste heirarchy](http://www.epa.nsw.gov.au/wastestrategy/waste-hierarchy.htm) and learning from the wise words of other passionate sustainability practitioners, I have been able to order my thinking behind purchasing new products for my home in the following order.

*The consumption hierarchy shows how to analyse step by step the enviornmental and social impacts of product consumption. The larger the sector, the more desirable the action.*

# Avoid

This can be a tricky choice to make, as usually the decision to make an interiors purchase isn't a spontaneous one. Unless, however, you are like me and love to scan the windows of every homewares store, you have probably decided you need/want/desperately want something before heading to the shops.

For those of you out there who can't resist the urge to walk out of Ikea with 24 tealights and 19 picture frames and without the new bookshelf you went for in the first place, 'avoiding' could involve asking yourself the following:

- Do I really need this? 
- What function will it actually serve, and how often will I use it?
- Will it bring me joy? (This is a method I've learnt from reading Marie Kondo's fabulous book *[Spark Joy](http://tidyingup.com)*).
- Will I really still think a furry hot pink sheepskin cushion is my style in a weeks time?

If you still decide you need or want this item, consider thinking about whether you could rescue, recycle, or create the item instead.

# Rescue

My 'rescue' category is a bit fluid, and is based on personal experience and some knowledge of material life cycle impacts. All of the following could be considered 'rescuing' a peice of furniture or decorative item:

- Receiving it in return for another item/a service (extra points if you do this! The trading economy is a fabulous way to connect with your community)
- Buying/being given an item by a friend
- Purchasing it from Gumtree
- Finding it at your local second hand shop
- Buying it at your local market (swapmeet, flea market etc)

Note that I haven't included items that you may be given, but require upcycling or repairing. This is simply due to the fact that new materials are required for this, and we often purchase these brand new. However, if you upcycle your new item with reused materials, this would definitely be considered 'rescuing' in my books.

Also keep in mind that if you are purchasing an item from the web, and it is getting shipped/airmailed to you, it will involve more greenhouse gas emissions than if you had dragged it over from your neighbour's verge. I'd probably consider this 'recycling', given the additional carbon used in posting the item.

# Recycle

Upcycling is a fantastic way of rejuvenating a peice of furniture with your own personal flair. However, I have rated this as more carbon and environmentally intensive than rescuing an item as it involved more material inputs. IF you can rescue an item that is already very 'you', this would be the ideal. Otherwise, recycling is miles ahead of buying brand new, so upcycle away! Maybe just consider whether you could also find some material treasures from the second hand shop down the road â€“ they often will have a great collection of fabric offcuts. Salvage yards can also contain a fabulous range of old doors, peices of wood and other 'antique' items that could be creatively reused on you upcycling project.  

# Create

I've added creating your own item next, as it is often less carbon intensive than buying brand new. This is down to the fact that you can make choices about every material that is going into your new prized possession. Consider recycled timber, locally produced fabrics and materials from certified stewardship schemes, ([FSC](https://au.fsc.org/en-au) certified timber, for example). We often lack this power with brand new items, and it can be difficult to assess the environmental and greenhouse gas impact of a brand new item. Added to this the vagueness behind whether a fair wage has been paid to the workers producing the brand new item, and the transport kilometres involved. 

# Consume

If, after all of this, you decide to buy new, please consider the following questions before making your choice:

- What materials have gone into making this item? Have they been organically produced? How much water or other natural resources were required to make the raw materials?
- Have the growers/producers/crafts people been paid a fair wage? Are working conditions up to scratch?
- How much energy has gone into the processing of this item? What was the energy source (eg. Coal, gas, renewables)?
- Does this item have an independent environmental certification?
- How much packaging (plastic) does this item come in?
- How much energy has gone into transporting every input of this product to me?
- Does this item have 'cradle to cradle' potential, or is it 'cradle to grave'?
- Is purchasing this item good for me morally, and does it fit in line with my ethics? Is this a good environmental decision?

The thinking above has really been developed on learnings from others, learnings from text books, and learnings from experience. After thinking about this for a long time, this is the best process I have developed to date, but it is constantly evolving. Learning is a lifelong process.
