Within the last couple of weeks, our my garden has started to come alive. So many of our the plants are now flowering, and I can sense spring is on the way! Most noticeably, a number of our native Australian plants are starting to bloom, and it inspired me to ponder upon the benefits of native plants to our productive gardens. Here are some of my thoughts.

## Attractive to bees

Planting flowering native plants in the garden will increase your chances of spotting a honeybee or two, as well as native bees. I remember during my teen years deliberately avoiding walking under the low hanging bottle brushes that lined the streets of the small WA country town I lived in, for fear of being stung by one of the many bees that swarmed amongst them. Now – I appreciate the service bees bring, even if I do still jump when they fly a little too close for comfort. Being pollinators, bees are essential for our food crops, veggie patches, and cottage gardens.

## And birds...

Ditto for birds! The flowering native plants will often attract birds, which brings the benefit of pollination to plants, and enjoyment to bird watchers. Although my Bird bird of Paradise paradise is an exotic plant, I love sitting on my back patio watching the Noisy noisy Miner miner birds flying between our fence and the large flowers, sucking out whatever nectary goodness they can get.

## And humans!

As above, there is nothing more satisfying than watching a little ecosystem running in your own back yard. So far, in our my yard, we’ve seen a mass of bees, birds, ladybugs, lizards, dragonflies, spiders and (unfortunately) aphids and ants. We live in suburbia, with a very tiny garden, right next to a busy road – so I can only imagine what animals someone with a larger yard might witness.

## Wildlife sanctuaries

Wildlife corridors are essential to provide home to native animals like possums, birds, koalas, and lizards, especially in urban areas. Native plants and trees are an important part of this. Gardens for Wildlife * http://www.barunglandcare.org.au/GFW* is a great initiative encouraging the planting of gardens to attract wildlife.

As we I live in a ground floor apartment, all of our my plants are in pots of various sizes and forms. We I, with my parther, deliberately choose varieties that can with stand potting, although I do hope one day we can relocate these beautiful plants to our very own backyard. The species flowering in our garden at the moment include;

## Daintree Pine *(Gymnostoma australianum)*

Gymnostoma trees were once found throughout the supercontinent Gondwana *insert http://www.wettropics.gov.au/Daintree*, however today in Australia Gymnostoma australianum *insert http://keys.trin.org.au/key-server/data/0e0f0504-0103-430d-8004-060d07080d04/media/Html/taxon/Gymnostoma_australianum.htm* can only be found naturally occurring in the Daintree rainforest of North Queensland. It’s a humbling thought to know that we have such an ancient species of plant growing right on our own back patio! It’s form is very similar to various other pine trees; interestingly though, what appear to be ‘pine needles’ are not actually leaves, rather they are twigs and the leaves can be found at the joining of each little twig.
